<h3>Installation</h3>
<ul>
<li>After clicking the link above, a dialog box will appear.  Select the Save File option and then click the OK button.</li>
<li>After downloading the zip file, you can install it by extracting
the folder contained in it. Location to where to extract those files
are shown below.<br>
</li>
<br><b>TIP: The chrome folder doesn't exist by default and needs to be created.<br>
</b>
<li>Put the extracted folder into the browser\chrome folder in the
folder where Pale Moon is installed.</li>
  <li>For example, on Windows, the
default location for the Pale Moon browser\chrome folder is <b>C:\Program Files\Pale Moon\browser\chrome</b>.</li>
  <li>Meanwhile, on Linux, the default location for the Pale Moon browser\chrome folder depends on your distro. Usually, it is at:</li>
  <span style="font-weight: bold;">.\Location-To-PM\browser\chrome</span><br>
  <br>
The Pale Moon browser\chrome folder may be in different locations depending on your current operating system.
  <br>
  <br>
<li>Once the extracted folder is in the Pale Moon browser\chrome
folder, all newly opened PM windows will have their upper left
corner icons styled to match Moonscape.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Uninstalling</h3>
If you would like to uninstall the icon pack, just delete the extracted
folder that you placed in the Pale Moon browser\chrome folder.
<br>
(NOTE: At present, the prior procedure is a bit more complicated. An install script [bat/sh] is planned in a future release)<br>
<br>

<h3><a name="readme"></a>Readme</h3><span style="font-weight: bold; text-decoration: underline;">Introduction</span><br style="font-weight: bold; text-decoration: underline;">
There is an area of theming that is overlooked by most theme
authors.&nbsp; This area is overlooked because few theme authors are aware of<br>its
existence.&nbsp; The lack of awareness is probably due to the fact that
themes are not presently able to apply a theme to the area that is
overlooked.<br>
<br>
In past versions of Firefox/Netscape, it allowed us to make custom
install scripts which in turn made installing icon packs easier.
However this functionality was removed (probably because of security
reasons) and therefore, we need to do the manual procedure for
installing icon packs. <br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold; text-decoration: underline;">What is an icon pack?</span><br style="font-weight: bold; text-decoration: underline;">
An icon pack allows you to change the icons that appear in the upper
left corner of the titlebar on the browser window.&nbsp; These icons can also
be seen on the taskbar. After installing an icon pack,
all newly opened windows will use the installed icons from the icon
pack.<br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold; text-decoration: underline;">Where can I get icon packs?</span><br>
Presently there is one main source for Firefox and Mozilla icon packs and related information located at:<br>
<br>
The Icon Packs Project - Firefox and Mozilla Icon Packs<br>
http://IconPacks.mozdev.org<br>
<br>
That web page is somewhat in disarray and not maintained well, but it
still has some good content. Aside from that web site there are only a
handful of other places on the web that have some icon packs.<br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold; text-decoration: underline;">What was done while creating the FOXSCAPE Icon Pack?</span><br>
In spite of similarities to the icons in the following icon pack, only four of the icons in this icon pack come from it.<br><br>
Classic Icon Pack for SeaMonkey/Mozilla Suite (Windows and Linux)<br>
http://iconpacks.mozdev.org/packs/classic.html<br>
<br>The bulk of the icons used in the FOXSCAPE Icon Pack were extracted directly
from the files in Netscape (version 4.8) and a few from other sources.<br><br>
The following four icons are the ones that were taken from the Classic Icon Pack mentioned above.<br>
&nbsp;mozilla.ico<br>
&nbsp;package.ico<br>
&nbsp;venkman-window.ico<br>
&nbsp;import-window.ico<br>
<br>
These four icons are not included in Netscape 4.8 and are unique to the
Classic Icon Pack.&nbsp; They may have come from an early version of
Mozilla.<span style="font-weight: bold; text-decoration: underline;"></span><br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold; text-decoration: underline;">File type icons</span><br style="font-weight: bold; text-decoration: underline;">
In the Classic Icon Pack and FOXSCAPE Icon Pack there are several icon
files which are meant to be used as icons that appear on the desktop of
your computer to represent various types of files.&nbsp; The Icon Packs
Project web site mentioned earlier gives no description of how one
would make these files become active in their computer's operating
system.&nbsp; I know it can be done, but for now, I will leave that to
you to figure out.&nbsp; In the future I might provide a description of
how to address this.&nbsp; Below is a list of the file type icons in
the FOXSCAPE Icon Pack.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;gif-file.ico<br>
&nbsp;html-file.ico&nbsp; (copy from main-window.ico)<br>
&nbsp;image-file.ico<br>
&nbsp;jpeg-file.ico&nbsp; (copy from png-file.ico)<br>
&nbsp;js-file.ico<br>
&nbsp;png-file.ico<br>
&nbsp;url-file.ico<br>
&nbsp;xhtml-file.ico (copy from main-window.ico)<br>
&nbsp;xml-file.ico&nbsp;&nbsp; (copy from url-file.ico)<br>
&nbsp;xul-file.ico&nbsp;&nbsp; (copy from url-file.ico)<br>
&nbsp;NSPage.ico&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (this can be used for a file type of your choice)<br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold; text-decoration: underline;">Program shortcut icons</span><br style="font-weight: bold; text-decoration: underline;">
There are several icons in the icon pack which could be used
to replace the standard icon used on program shortcuts to Firefox.<br>
Unfortunately, at the present time the only way to make these icons
active is to use a special utility program (like resource hacker) to
directly<br>replace
the default Firefox icons in the program with the ones in the Moonscape
Icon Pack.&nbsp; You can refer to the Icon Packs Project web
site<br>
mentioned earlier to read more about using these icons.&nbsp; Below is
a list of the icons in the Moonscape Icon Pack that are likely to be
used as<br>
replacements for the default program shortcut icons.<br>
<br>
Netscape.ico<br>
Communicator.ico<br>
main-window.ico<br>
mozilla.ico<br>
package.ico<br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold; text-decoration: underline;">Closing</span><br style="font-weight: bold; text-decoration: underline;">
Feel free to use any parts of this icon pack in your own creations. You
need to give Michael Walden, the FOXSCAPE Icon Pack, and the current
maintainer of this theme a bit
of credit in your creation.&nbsp; Thanks in advance.<br>
