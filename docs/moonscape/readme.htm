<h3>I. Position the throbber</h3>

After restarting, you should do the following two steps.<br/>

<ol>
  <li><span class="bold">Open the Customize Toolbar window</span> - Right click on the home button and choose Customize... on the popup menu that appears. Alternatively, you can get there using the menu bar by clicking View > Toolbars > Customize...</li>
  <li><span class="bold">Relocate the Activity Indicator (a.k.a Throbber)</span> - Assuming that your installation of Pale Moon is fresh, the Throbber will be
located in the Customize Toolbar window. If needed, drag the throbber from it's current position and drop it on the right hand side of the Navigation toolbar (to the right of the search control).
<br class="mb"/>
If after moving the Throbber you are satisfied with the layout of the browser then you can just click on the Done button and you are finished. If you would like to make things look as close as possible to one of the supported browser families (Netscape 4.x, Netscape 6.x, Mozilla M18+, SeaMonkey 1.0+), then continue on to the following section.</li>
</ol>

<h3>II. Netscape 4.x Toolbar Layout</h3>
If you wish to make Pale Moon look like the Netscape 4.x family of browsers, do the following steps. Otherwise, go to the following section.
<ol>
  <li><span class="bold">Make a Location Toolbar</span> - In the Customize Toolbar window, click on Add New Toolbar, enter Location Toolbar as the name, and click OK to continue. You will see a new blank toolbar appear below the Navigation toolbar and above the Bookmarks toolbar. Drag the existing Location bar and Search bar from the Navigation toolbar and place them on the new Location toolbar so they appear in the following left to right order.
	<div><span class="bold">Location Toolbar</span><br/></div>

	<ol>
	  <li>Bookmarks Menu (Appears with a
	dropmark symbol (down pointing triangle) on the right of the folder)</li>
	  <li>Location</li>
	  <li>Search</li>
	  <li>Subscribe<br/>
	  </li>
	</ol>
	<em>The subscribe button is optional here, and may be alternatively positioned on the navigation toolbar as described below.</em>
	</li>
</ol>

<ol start="2">
  <li><span class="bold">Customize the Navigation Toolbar</span> - Now that the Location bar and Search bar are not taking up space on the Navigation toolbar, drag and drop controls as needed to produce a Navigation toolbar control layout that matches the following left to right layout order. Note that items seven through 24 were not available in Netscape 4.x.
  <br class="mb"/>
<em>They are presented here in an order that makes logical sense, and as they may have been arranged in a hypothetical evolution of Netscape 4.x that gained functionality. They are optional, and may be left out if you wish to adhere to a more classic look.</em>

<br/>
Be sure to position a Flexible Space item on the left hand side of the Throbber to make the Throbber always appear at the far right end of the Navigation toolbar if the browser window size is expanded.<br/>
</li>
</ol>


<ol start="3">

  <li><span class="bold">Icon Text</span> - The final
important step is to make the icons display
their corresponding text labels by selecting Icons and Text in
the Show: drop down selector located in the lower left corner of the
Customize Toolbar window. Also note that the Use Small Icons checkbox
should be unchecked to produce the large icons typically seen in
Netscape. When you are finished customizing the layout, click Done to
finish
unless you want to do the following optional step.</li>
  <li><span class="bold">Simulate Grippies</span> - This
optional step allows you to change the toolbars to approximate the
appearance of toolbar
grippies, though they will not function. Simply drag two
Separator items
to the left end of the following bars: Menu Bar, Navigation Toolbar,
Location
Toolbar, and the Bookmarks Toolbar. Click Done to finish.</li>
  <li><span class="bold">Don't always show the tab bar </span>-
This optional step saves some space and hides the tab bar when there is
only 1 open tab since during the Netscape 4.x era, tabs functionality
don't exist yet. Go to the options window, in the Tabs tab, uncheck the
"Always show the tab bar" option. Click OK to apply the changes.<br/>
  </li>
</ol>

<h3>III. Netscape 6-7.x, Mozilla
M18+, SeaMonkey 1.0+ Toolbar
Layout</h3>

If you wish to make your browser look like one of the following
browser families: Netscape 6-7.x, Mozilla Milestone 18 to 1.7.x, or<br/>

SeaMonkey 1.0 to 2.x, then do the following steps. Otherwise, go
to the following section.<br/>

<ol>

  <li><span class="bold">Customize the Navigation Toolbar</span>
- With the Customize Toolbar window open, Drag and drop controls as
needed to produce a
Navigation toolbar control layout that matches the following left to
right
layout order.</li>
</ol>

<span class="bold"></span>
<div class="ml"><span class="bold">Navigation

 1. Back<br/>
 2. Forward<br/>
 3. Reload<br/>
 4. Stop<br/>
 5. Location<br/>
 6. Search<br/>
 7. Print<br/>
 8. Activity Indicator (Throbber)<br/>
<br/>
Lastly, if you are trying to make Pale Moon look like one of
the browser families other than Netscape 6.x, be sure to read to the
section titled "Included throbbers" to see how to make the throbber
look
like the one from the browser family you desire.<br/>
</div>

<br/>

<ol start="2">

  <li><span class="bold">Customize the Bookmarks Toolbar</span>
- Drag and drop controls as needed to produce a Bookmarks toolbar

<h1 class="sticky-header" id="Advanced_Customization"><span class="bold">Advanced Customization</span></h1>

<span style="font-style: italic;"></span>Further customization of Moonscape can be accomplished through use of subskins. Subskins are portions of a theme that are not enabled by default. They can optionally be enabled by the user.<br/><br/>

There are two included subskin templates which will allow you to easily pick and choose subskin features to be enable. This is done by simply un-commenting lines to enable their associated subskins. The templates can be seen by entering the following address into the address bar:<br/>

<br/>

chrome://subskins/skin/config<br/>

<br/>

Copy each template text block from the page above and paste each one
into the file specified in the comments at the top of each text
block.
Be sure to place the text blocks at the specified position (top or
bottom) in each file. You can also paste the contents of this file as a
user style for use in Stylish. <br/>

<br/>

Now you can un-comment lines in the copied templates to enable their
associated subskins. For example, in the userChrome.css file, you
can<br/>

enable the modern keyhole style back and forward buttons subskin by
changing the following line:<br/>

<br/>

/* @import
url("chrome://subskins/skin/sub/Enable_keyhole_back_and_forward_buttons.css");
*/<br/>

<br/>

to it's un-commented form:<br/>

<br/>

 @import
url("chrome://subskins/skin/sub/Enable_keyhole_back_and_forward_buttons.css");
<br/>

<br/>

After saving your changes, restart Pale Moon or save the user style to
make the changes active.<br/>

Now you should see the modern keyhole style back and forward buttons.<br/>

<br/>

Each subskin are named in a way that would clearly describe the
function it performs. The subskin name is capitalized in the
sample line below to illustrate where it occurs on each template line:<br/>

<br/>

/* @import url("chrome://subskins/skin/sub/SUBSKIN-NAME.CSS");
*/<br/>

<br/>

Experiment by un-commenting one line at a time to learn what each
subskin does.<br/>

<br/>

Each default subskin will be in the format depicted
below.<br/>

/* -import url("ADDRESS"); */ /* --------------------------------
DEFAULT */<br/>

<br/>

These default subskins are not meant to be un-commented. I
changed the "@" character that should be on the left of "import" to a
"-" character to
make the default subskin lines visually stand out from the other
subskins
and to serve as a mental reminder to not use these subskins.
These
subskins are here to allow you to see the default settings that
Moonscape will have
and to allow you to view the code that produces the named result. The
following section will describe how to view a subskin's code (content).<br/>

<br/>

<h3><span class="bold">
Using Moonscape subskins with other themes</span></h3>

All Moonscape subskins that have names that end in "_Fx.css" should
work
with themes other than Moonscape. If you wish to use one of these
subskins with a theme other than Moonscape, you must copy the complete
content of the subskin and paste it into the appropriate user .css file
(userContent.css or userChrome.css) or user style. <br/>

<br/>

Alternatively, you could paste it into a file
stored on your hard drive and use it by entering a line into the
appropriate
user .css file (userContent.css or userChrome.css) similar to the
following:<br/>

<br/>

@import url("file:///c:/Moonscape/include.css");<br/>

<br/>

In that example, the copied content of the subskin is stored in a
file called include.css. It is stored in a folder called Moonscape in
the root<br/>

of the C: drive on a Windows based computer.<br/>

<br/>

To see the content of a Moonscape subskin, enter it's address into the
address bar in Pale Moon while Moonscape is enabled. Below is an
example of a subskin address from a line in the templates:<br/>

<br/>

A line from the templates:<br/>

<br/>

/* @import url("chrome://subskins/skin/sub/SUBSKIN-NAME.CSS");
*/<br/>

<br/>

The subskin address from the template line above:<br/>

<br/>

chrome://subskins/skin/sub/SUBSKIN-NAME.CSS<br/>

<h3>Preset templates</h3>

In addition to the templates mentioned above, I have also included the
two templates that M.W are using in his installation of FOXSCAPE.<br/>

<br/>

These will allow you to get a taste of what can be done with the
included subskins. You can use his preset templates by simply
adding one
line to two files.<br/>

<br/>

1. Copy the following line and insert it at the top of userChrome.css<br/>

<br/>

@import url("chrome://subskins/skin/sub/0-MyUserChrome.css");<br/>

<br/>

2. Copy the following line and append it at the end of userContent.css<br/>

<br/>

@import url("chrome://subskins/skin/sub/0-MyUserContent.css");<br/>

<br/>

After saving your changes, restart Pale Moon to make the preset
templates active.<br/>

<br/>

Alternatively, you could copy those lines and paste it into a new user
style, which doesn't require a restart.<br/>

<br/>

You may view the content of the two templates by entering the following
addresses into the address bar and pressing enter:<br/>

<br/>

chrome://subskins/skin/sub/0-MyUserChrome.css<br/>

<br/>

chrome://subskins/skin/sub/0-MyUserContent.css<br/>

<br/>

You will then be able to see which subskins have been enabled.
You can also use these two addresses in place of the following address<br/>

<br/>

chrome://subskins/skin/config<br/>

<br/>

in the
steps described at the beginning of the Advanced Customization section.
You will then be able to alter these settings to your
liking.<br/>

<br/>

<h3>
The profile-directory/chrome/ folder</h3>

The userContent.css and userChrome.css files mentioned in this readme
file are located in the chrome folder that is stored in the <br/>

profile-directory folder. The profile-directory folder will be in
a different place on almost every machine. The location is affected<br/>

by the operating system type and version, as well as user name and
other factors. So, this makes it difficult to describe the
location<br/>

in this file. An example of where you would find the chrome folder on a
Windows 7 based computer appears below:<br/>

<br/>

C:\Users\[Windows Login Name]\AppData\Roaming\Moonchild
Productions\Pale Moon\Profiles\[Random String].[Name]\chrome\<br/>

<br/>

[Windows Login Name] and [Random String] will vary. [Name] may be
"default" or something else if you set up the profile yourself using
the profile manager.<br/>

<br/>

There is a feature that can be used to open the profile
directory, allowing you to simply open the chrome folder that contains
the userContent.css and userChrome.css files mentioned in this readme.<br/>

<br/>

To open the profile directory, go to the about:support address or go to
Help &gt; Troubleshooting Information... on the menu bar. Once
that<br/>

page loads, Under the "Application Basics" section, there's a row with
a title "Profile Folder", beside it click the Open Folder button.
Your screen should display a window containing the files
that are in the profile folder on your computer.<br/>

<br/>

Take a look at the following web pages for additional information on
subskins and the location of the profile-directory folder:<br/>

<br/>

http://projectit.com/subskins.html<br/>

http://home.comcast.net/~username54321/starfield/usingsubskins.html<br/>

http://support.mozilla.com/kb/profiles<br/>

<br/>

<h3>
Un-commenting</h3>

Un-comment lines by removing the leading /* and trailing */ comment
indicators. You *must* be certain to remove both leading and
trailing<br/>

comment indicators for a given line or things will not function
properly.<br/>

<br/>

When un-commenting lines in the templates, it is recommended that you
replace the leading /* characters with two spaces characters. That<br/>

enables you to easily see which lines are enabled by making them stand
out from the commented lines. If you decide to disable an enabled
line,<br/>

just replace the removed /* and */ comment indicators and remove the
two leading space characters if present.<br/>

<br/>

After making comment changes, be sure to restart Pale Moon to make the
changes active (or simply save the user style if you're using the other
method).<br/>

<br/>

<h3>
Included throbbers</h3>

Below are the descriptions of, and subskin entries for, the throbber
files included in Moonscape. Refer to the "Advanced
Customization"
section to see how to use the subskin entries below.<br/>

<br/>

Netscape N Throbber (From Netscape 4.x - 6.2.3)<br/>

*/<br/>

<br/>

<h3>
Included image files</h3>

There are five splash/logo files included in the Moonscape theme. These
images may be accessed from a customized about:blank page (also
described in this file) or from extensions, such as the Splash
extension.<br/>

<br/>

There are also six .htm files included to demonstrate the included
images. You can go to the address of each .htm file to get an
idea of what the images will look like when called from a custom
about:blank page or, to an extent, the Splash extension.<br/>

<br/>

These demonstration .htm files may also be used as your home page by
placing the address of one into the Home Page field in the Main tab on<br/>

the Options screen. When using one as your home page, you can get
almost the same effect as if you had installed the Splash extension or
a custom about:blank page without actually doing so.<br/>

<br/>

There is one extra .htm (0.) file relative to the number of included
image files (five). This extra .htm file is included to
demonstrate<br/>

what a custom gray about:blank page (described in this file) will look
like.<br/>

<br/>

Here are the links to the image files and their associated .htm files.<br/>

<br/>

<h3>
Using the Splashed! extension</h3>

Included in this theme are images which can be used with the
"Splashed!"
Pale Moon extension, which is a fork of the "Splash!" extension, is
available at the following address:<br/>

<br/>

Splashed! 1.0.0 (or newer) by FranklinDM<br/>

<a href="https://addons.palemoon.org/addon/splashed/">https://addons.palemoon.org/addon/splashed/</a><br/>

<br/>

The recommended settings for "Splashed!" are as follows:<br/>

<br/>

Splash Settings<br/>

 General<br/>

 [/] Show Splash on Startup<br/>

 [ ] Close splash when main window loads<br/>

 Auto-close Timeout (1000 = 1 sec): 8000
(Default: 3000)<br/>

 Background Color:
transparent
(Default: #FFFFFF)<br/>

 Window Style: padding: 0px;<br/>

 Image<br/>

 Image URL (ex: file:///c:/image.png):
chrome://subskins/skin/spl/splash-3.gif
(Default: chrome://branding/content/about.png)<br/>

 Text<br/>

 [/] Hide splash text
completely
(Default: [ ])<br/>

 [/] Hide progress
meter
(Default: [ ])<br/>

 Override "loading..." text (leave blank for default):<br/>

 Text Color: #000000<br/>

 Text Style: font-family: sans-serif; font-size: medium;
font-weight: bold; text-align: center;<br/>

 Miscellaneous<br/>

 Sound<br/>

 [ ] Play sound on startup<br/>

 Sound URL (ex: file:///c:/sound.wav):<br/>

 Opacity<br/>

 [ ] Use Opacity (value range is from 0-1 Ex. '.4')<br/>

<br/>

You can change the "Image URL" to any one of the included image file<br/>

addresses described elsewhere in this file.<br/>

<br/>

<h3>
Custom about:blank page</h3>

The Netscape 4.x browsers would start up (if no home page was
specified) with a gray colored page. When new windows were
created they also appeared with a gray colored page. Even though
there was no
formally defined about:blank page in Netscape, the about:blank page is
the<br/>

PM equivalent to Netscape's initial gray page.<br/>

<br/>

If you would like to make Pale Moon's about:blank page appear like the
gray page in Netscape, either add the following line of text to the<br/>

bottom of your chrome\userContent.css file or un-comment the existing
line in your chrome\userContent.css file. See the Advanced
Customization section for details.<br/>

<br/>

@import
url("chrome://subskins/skin/sub/Gray_about_blank_Fx.css");<br/>

<br/>

Alternatively, you might want to include an image in the center of the
about:blank page to give your empty about:blank page a bit of style.<br/>

There is an example of a customized about:blank page that
displays a Moonscape splash image that disappears after 5 seconds and
leaves a static Moonscape logo. If you would like to try out this
example,
either add the following line of text to the bottom of your<br/>

chrome\userContent.css file or un-comment the existing line in your
chrome\userContent.css file. See the Advanced Customization
section for<br/>

details.<br/>

<br/>

@import
url("chrome://subskins/skin/sub/Gray_about_blank_with_splash-3.css");<br/>

<br/>

If you would like to create a customized about:blank page with a
different image than the one in my example, you can extract the
complete content of the subskin example above and place it at the
bottom of your chrome\userContent.css file, as described in the "Using
Moonscape
subskins with other themes" section, but in this case use the subskin
with Moonscape, and then you can change the image name in the
url("IMAGE_NAME") line in the extracted subskin content to any one of
the included image file addresses described in the "Included image
files" section of this file.<br/>

<br/>

You can even use an image file (.png, .gif, .jpg) located on your hard
drive by using an image name similar to the following example.<br/>

<br/>

url("file:///c:/Moonscape/image.png")<br/>

<br/>

In that example, the image file on your hard drive is stored in a file
called image.png. It is stored in a folder called Moonscape in
the root<br/>

of the C: drive.<br/>

<br/>

To clarify, the existing line would be changed from:<br/>

 background:-moz-dialog
url("chrome://subskins/skin/spl/splash-3.gif") no-repeat fixed
50% 50% !important;<br/>

to<br/>

 background:-moz-dialog
url("file:///c:/Moonscape/image.png") no-repeat fixed 50% 50%
!important;<br/>

<br/>
